## What is Java Spring Boot?

Java Spring Framework (Spring Framework) is a popular, open source, enterprise-level framework for creating standalone, production-grade applications that run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

[Java Spring Boot (Spring Boot)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/java-spring-boot#toc-spring-boo-HII6V_zV) is a tool that makes developing web application and microservices with Spring Framework faster and easier through three core capabilities:

- Autoconfiguration
- An opinionated approach to configuration
- The ability to create standalone applications


These features work together to provide you with a tool that allows you to set up a Spring-based application with minimal configuration and setup.
